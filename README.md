# My personal website

I've build my personal website with the framework [Astro](https://astro.build), reusing some of the structure from the theme Dante by [justgoodui.com](https://justgoodui.com/).

## Project Structure

Inside of the package, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro (`.astro`) components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
