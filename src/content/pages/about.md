## Fusing two decades of hands-on expertise with lateral thinking and heart.

I am a creator who provide expertise in areas ranging from digital product processes, strategy and innovation to UX- and service design.

Through my consulting studio, I help my clients craft what’s new by mapping, reframing, prototyping and strategic design. I guide my clients with heart through their digital evolution, helping them create tangible value at all touchpoints. 

I have spent my last few years coaching and leading, infusing a design mindset as a natural, integrated part in organizations. I have about 20 years of experience in various design roles, mostly in hands-on design work, but also engaging people from different disciplines, unlocking the capabilities of mixed teams and tuning org level processes and strategies accordingly. Big picture thinking, but with feet on the ground.

## On a personal level
I am a father of three. I tend to see patterns and connect the seemingly unrelated. I am prone to use my intuition. I often find myself filled with awe and wonder. 

I value people who are willing to throw themselves to openness and have made some progress in their awareness journey. I am not afraid of challenging existing structures. You might want to classify me as neurodivergent. I thrive in fringe environments driven by heart and curiosity.

Areas of interest includes but is not limited to psychology, complexity, emergence, mind, biology/biomimicry, swarms, play, macro trends/economics, poetry, perspective shifting. I tend to think of ecologies of ideas, rather than domains.

I believe we have a responsibility as human beings. You, me – we are here for a glimpse of time. But we *do* have agency. Aspire for wisdom to pair it with, and we can talk about **true** impact. I'd love to be in the company of those who share this aspiration.

Just like you - fragmented and imperfect, enough and beautiful - what's being shared on LinkedIn can ever just capture the tiniest fraction of us.
